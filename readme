### **Storyline:**

The protagonist, an amateur coder and urban explorer with a knack for solving mysteries, hears rumors about a forgotten neighborhood rumored to “glitch” into view only for those who know where to look. Intrigued, they download a mysterious app called *Spectre*, which uses augmented reality to reveal the location. 

Following hints and digital breadcrumbs, they navigate through city back alleys and abandoned streets until they reach the neighborhood. Once inside, they lose cell service and find that the app glitches, distorting time and space. As they explore, they encounter cryptic messages, digital echoes of people who once lived there, and signs of a corporate conspiracy covering up a terrible secret.

### **Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Augmented Reality Exploration**:
   - The player navigates a 2D map but relies on their in-game phone’s AR view to reveal hidden elements and clues that are “invisible” in the real world.
   - The AR view shows digital traces like messages, ghostly outlines, or broken digital signs.

2. **Puzzle Solving & Hacking**:
   - The protagonist uses hacking skills to bypass digital locks and security systems, collecting clues on a makeshift tablet.
   - Solving each puzzle unlocks new areas, such as accessing an abandoned building’s camera feed or hacking into a locked digital archive.
   - Codes, passwords, and hidden messages must be deciphered to reveal the neighborhood’s mystery.

3. **Glitch Encounters**:
   - Occasionally, glitchy “guardians” or strange, corrupted digital entities will appear, triggered by the protagonist’s actions.
   - The player must evade these entities by hiding in shadows, turning off devices, or “rebooting” their AR view to temporarily reset the surroundings.

4. **Inventory & Tool System**:
   - The player carries a backpack with hacking tools, an external battery, a flashlight, and a map.
   - Items are upgraded over time—such as increasing the phone’s battery life, which is drained each time they use the AR view.

5. **Timed Mystery and Day/Night Cycle**:
   - The game has a real-time day/night cycle; some parts of the town can only be accessed at night when security is low, while others are safer in the daylight.
   - Time adds pressure as strange “glitches” occur more frequently at night, forcing the player to plan carefully.

6. **Choices and Multiple Endings**:
   - The player’s decisions impact their progress. They can confront the corporate backstory, leak data to the public, or escape before finding the full truth.
   - Multiple endings range from escaping with only fragments of the mystery, uncovering the full truth, or getting “locked” in the glitched neighborhood.

### **Key Locations**:

- **Abandoned Cyber Café**: Once a gathering place for tech enthusiasts, it’s now full of discarded hard drives with hidden messages and clues.
- **Subway Station**: Closed down for “renovation,” it’s a hub of glitchy events where old surveillance footage reveals what happened to previous visitors.
- **Corporate HQ**: A high-security building where the player can hack terminals to gain vital data on the district’s mysterious erasure from city records.
- **Underground Server Room**: Hidden in the subway, this room holds the core data for the neighborhood’s glitchy history. Breaking into it reveals the final piece of the puzzle.

### **Atmosphere**:

With a dark, neon-lit aesthetic, the game captures the feel of a modern, urban mystery. Glitchy visual effects give an eerie, unsettling atmosphere, with sounds of static and distorted whispers that intensify as the player nears significant clues. Suspenseful music heightens the tension as each clue and encounter brings the protagonist closer to uncovering the truth.

### **Objective & Goal**:

The ultimate goal is to survive the night in Glitchtown, uncover the conspiracy, and escape with evidence of the truth before the protagonist’s phone battery dies, leaving them lost in the glitch for good.
